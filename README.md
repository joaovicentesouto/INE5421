# Description

This repository aims to develop an application for creating, modifying and manipulating the manipulation of formal devices studied in the discipline of Formal Languages and Compilers.

## Assignment

### Definition:
Prepare an application to handle Finite Automaton (FA), Regular Grammar (RG) and Regular Expression (RE), which involves the following operations / functionalities:
* Ed, read and write RG and RE.
* Conversion of RE to FA using the Simone algorithm.
* Transformation from RG to FA and vice versa.
* Determination and Minimization of FA.
* Obtaining FA's that represent the intersection, difference and reverse of LR's (expressed by RG, RE and FA).
* Obtaining RG resulting from union, concatenation and closure of RG's.
* Recognition of sentences accepted by an FA and enumeration of sentences of size "n" accepted by him.

### Comments:
* For the edition and reading of RG and RE the standards seen in class should be used.
    * Examples: RG: S-> aS | a and RE: a * (b? C | d) *.
* Present the AFs in the form of transition tables.
* Alphabet symbols must be size 1 and may be limited to lowercase letters and digits.
* Use & to represent epsilon.
* The edition of the productions of the RG's must be textual (direct); that is, there is no need for explicit definition of Vn and Vt and the initial symbol will be first defined Vn;
* All AFs involved (resulting and intermediate) in one operation / check shall be viewable and reusable in other operations / verifications.
* In addition to the correction, aspects of usability and robustness will be evaluated.

## How to compile
